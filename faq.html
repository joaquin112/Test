				Q. How long will it take to repair my system?
				
			</dt>
			
				
			<dd>
				
					A. It all depends on which system you have and what the issue is. For light error issues on a PS3 or an XBOX it takes about an hour. We try to have all light error issues fixed in an hour or less. For disk drive issues, such as the drive has stopped reading blu-rays or games it takes about 25 minutes to repair.
